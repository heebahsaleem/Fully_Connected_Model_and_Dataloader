# Fully_Connected_Model_and_Dataloader

This covers basic math tools, artificial neural network, multilayered perceptrons, backpropagation, deep convolutional neural network.
The algorithms are applied to linear regression and image classification.

**Dataset**

MNIST dataset has been used.

**Result**
 We can observe that as the loss decreases, the accuracy of the model increases.  This indicates the successful convergence of the model.
 The losses can further be reduced if it is trained for more epochs and accuracy may be increased.
